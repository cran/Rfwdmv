Bugs:

(1) Fix the slope problem in partition.

(2) Figure out what's going on with fwdmvEllipsePlot.  Boxplots don't look right.


Improvements:

(1) If the elements of the diagonal of the covariance matrix are all equal to 1 then label should be correlation.

(2) In confirm.plot only show the units that change classification in the plot.  Make plot work better.


New Features:

(1) Make a function called pcscores.plot.fwdmv that plots the scores for each subset.

(2) Make a forward screeplot where the user selects which steps to see.

(3) Make a forward biplot where the user selects which steps to see.

(4) Make a forward score vs score plot where the user selects which steps to see (pg 272).

(5) Make a function that does univariate boxplots and put outliers labels on alternating sides.

(6) 3 row distances plot; see page 400

(7) Add id capability to change and entry plots.


For next version:

(1) Zoom and row highlighting in the entry order plot.

(2) redo the implementation of alpha and beta.

Ask Brian:

(1) How to make id instructions appear in Windows.

(2) Can we use \link to link to files on the web.
